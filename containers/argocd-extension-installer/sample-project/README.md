### For Complete Beginners:
- **A computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- **Basic computer skills** (knowing how to open files and folders)
- **An internet connection** (to download the tools)

### Tools You'll Install:
1. **Docker** - Think of this as a "magic box" that contains everything your extension manager needs
2. **A web browser** - Like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (you probably already have this!)

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Docker
**What is Docker?** Docker is like a "magic box" that contains everything your extension manager needs to run. It's like having a mini-computer inside your computer!

**How to install:**
1. Go to [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Download Docker Desktop for your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux)
3. Install it like any other software
4. Start Docker Desktop

**How to check if it's working:**
```bash
docker --version
```
If you see something like "Docker version 20.10.x", you're good to go!

### Step 2: Pull the ArgoCD Extension Installer Image
**What we're doing:** We're downloading the ArgoCD extension manager from the internet.

```bash
# Pull the ArgoCD Extension Installer image from Docker Hub
docker pull cleanstart/argocd-extension-installer:latest
```

### Step 3: Choose a Sample Project
**Start with Basic Extensions if you're new to ArgoCD:**

```bash
# Navigate to the basic extensions example
cd images/argocd-extension-installer/sample-project/basic-extensions

### Prerequisites for Testing
```bash
# Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Pull the ArgoCD Extension Installer image from Docker Hub
docker pull cleanstart/argocd-extension-installer:latest
```

### Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

#### 1. Navigate to Sample Project
```bash
# Navigate to the basic extensions example
cd images/argocd-extension-installer/sample-project/basic-extensions
```

#### 2. Start the Sample Project
```bash

# Verify all containers are running
docker ps
```

#### 3. Test Container Status
```bash
# Check if all containers are healthy
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"

# Expected output should show:
# argocd-extensions-basic     Up X minutes (healthy)     0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
```

#### 4. Test Web Interfaces

**Test Extension Installer Web Interface:**

docker-compose down

# Remove all related containers and networks
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans

# Verify cleanup
docker ps | grep argocd
```

### Expected Test Results

**‚úÖ Successful Test Indicators:**
- Extension installer container shows "Up" status with "(healthy)"
- Web interface returns HTTP 200 OK
- Can access extension dashboard
- Can browse available extensions
- Can install basic extensions

**‚ùå Common Issues to Watch For:**
- Port conflicts (containers won't start)
- Permission denied errors (Docker socket access)
- Network connectivity issues (web interface not accessible)
- Resource constraints (containers fail to start)
- Volume mount issues (extension data persistence problems)

## üêõ Troubleshooting (Common Problems)

### Problem: "Docker command not found"
**Solution:** Docker isn't installed or isn't running
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is installed
2. Start Docker Desktop
3. Wait for it to fully start (you'll see a green icon)

### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Something else is using the ports
```bash
# Stop the current project
docker-compose down

# Check what's using the ports
netstat -tulpn | grep :8080

# Stop conflicting containers
docker stop <container-name>
```

### Problem: "Cannot connect to the application"
**Solution:** Check if the containers are running
```bash
# See all running containers
docker ps

# If containers aren't running, start them again
docker-compose up -d
```

### Problem: "Extensions won't install"
**Solution:** Check the container logs
```bash
# Check detailed logs
docker logs argocd-extensions-basic

# Check if the extension manager is healthy
docker ps
```

### Problem: "Health check failing"
**Solution:** Wait for container to fully start
```bash
# Wait a few seconds for the extension manager to initialize
sleep 10

# Check health status again
docker ps
```
